\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Aims}
The challenge was to harvest energy from three different energy sources and deliver to an electrochemical device (i.e. the flag) to measure the amount of energy transmitted. 

\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Capture energy from at least two of three sources (either wind, light, or electric)
	\item Transfer stored energy to the flag mechanism
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Project Restrictions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The playing field was a 8 foot by 8 foot medium-density fibreboard (MDF) surface divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant consisted of an energy source in the corner. 
	\item Energy Sources
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Light Source: 50 Watt Halogen MR16 GU10 Base Flood Light Bulb powered by 115 V, 60 Hz Outlet. Center of bulb was 6 inches above the playing field. Circular surface of bulb was 6 inches away from the inside surface of the perimeter. 
		\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
