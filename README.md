Note: Only Windows is supported.


### Getting started with Git ###

1. Create a free GitHub account on [github.com](https://github.com/signup/free).
2. Follow GitHub's great instructions for installing [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) on your computer.

### Forking Rasware ###

1. Once logged into GitHub, go to [ut-ras](https://github.com/ut-ras)'s [Rasware2012](https://github.com/ut-ras/Rasware2012).
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the project's code through the button on the top right. This will copy the project to your own account.
3. Open Git. Depending on what version is installed, the commands will be slightly different.
4. Do Git Clone to create a copy of the project on your computer. In GitHub for Windows, simply click on `clone` next to the Rasware2012 project.
5. Right click on Rasware2012 then click on `open in explorer` to open the folder containing the project.

### Install Putty ###

Additional Information
----------------------

Keil uVision (we pronounce it as _Kyle Micro-Vision_) is an _Integrated Development Environment_ or IDE for short. Other popular IDEs are Netbeans, Eclipse, IDLE, and VisualStudio
* What is an IDE? <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment>

Git is an implementation of something called _version control_ which we use to maintain code in RAS. You might have heard of SVN, or subversion, which is another popular version control. Although it isn't necessary to do well in Robotaton, learning more about git, GitHub, and version control would be a smart idea.
* What is version control? <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control>
* Why use version control? <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1408450/why-should-i-use-version-control>

When running PuTTY, we used _115200_ as the speed of the connection. This is the _baud rate_ of the USB connection on the board.
* What is a baud rate and how is it calculated? <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud>
